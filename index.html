                    <p>Lucid Capital is an exclusive Discord community dedicated to options trading.

Our community is designed for traders of all experience levels to collaborate, learn, and grow.</p>

                <div id="answer2" class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Each individual's acceptable level of risk and ideal amount of capital per transaction varies. It's best to operate within your comfort zone. Paper trading serves as an excellent stepping stone into the realm of options trading. It allows you to venture without jeopardizing real money, providing the freedom to learn from your mistakes without severe consequences.</p>

                    How many trades do you take?

                <div id="answer3" class="faq-answer">
                    <p>For me, simplicity reigns supreme. My focus is heavily geared towards trades with substantial risk/reward ratios that have high R-Multiples. Depending on the opportunities the market offers, this might translate to one or two trades per day, or one to three trades per week. We typically concentrate on one or two long-term swings (trades with longer expiration periods), while also capitalizing on intraday trades as they arise from our preparation the previous day. You will never find me forcing a trade that isn't there for a flashy screenshot.</p>

                    Can I expect to make a ton of money when I join?
                </button>
                <div id="answer4" class="faq-answer">
                    <p>To be frank, providing a definitive answer to this question is challenging. Options trading is a complex undertaking. As traders, we all experience peaks and troughs, but managing these ebbs and flows effectively is paramount. It requires disciplined risk management. Making and losing money are both part of the game; this much is nearly certain. However, the truly exceptional traders never relinquish more than their earnings and understand precisely when it's time to step away from the table. Achieving success requires an unquenchable desire for knowledge and progress. It's essential to become skillful at dealing with losses, cultivating grace in victory, and striving to understand the intricacies of the emotional and psychological dynamics involved in trading.</p>

                <div id="answer5" class="faq-answer">
                    <p>My trading schedule runs from Monday to Friday, with live voice trading taking place from Monday to Wednesday between 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM. Each evening, I finish and submit daily watchlists complete with trade plans for the subsequent day. Additionally, I record a trade recap every other day to review all trades made and the reasoning behind them. Sundays are dedicated to our weekly preparation. This is the day for our streams, workshops, and chart preparations. The charts are typically released around 9 PM Eastern Standard Time.</p>
